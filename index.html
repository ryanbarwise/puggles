      <p>Dogs were never my favorite animal until I wound up in a relationship eight years ago with someone who had two new puggle puppies. I didn't love them much at first as they seemed very hyper and starved for attention. I had previously been a cat owner and was used to their mainly calm disposition and occasional friskiness.</p>

      <h2>Fast-forward 8 years...</h2>
      <p>The past 8 years with Chili and Belle wouldn't have been nearly as exciting and joyful as they have been if it weren't for the two precious dogs. My initial hesitation towards them quickly faded as I realized that although quite energetic, they are the most loving creatures I have ever met. They make me happy, and I try to do the same for them.
