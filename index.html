      <p>Dogs were never my favorite animal until I wound up in a relationship eight years ago with someone who had two new puggle puppies. Initially I felt a little uneasy around them as they seemed very hyper and starved for attention. I had previously been a cat owner and was used to their mainly calm disposition and occasional friskiness.</p>

      <h2>who would have thought?</h2>
      <p>The past 8 years with Chili and Belle wouldn't have been nearly as exciting and joyful as they have been if it weren't for these two dogs. My initial hesitation towards them quickly faded as I began to love their excitement and enthusiasm for life. They helped me get through four years living in frigid Iowa and their excitement of daily summertime walks helped make each year more tolerable.They are the most loving creatures I have ever met. They make me happy, and I try to do the same for them.
